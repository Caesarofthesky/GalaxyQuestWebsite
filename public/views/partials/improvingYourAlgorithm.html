  <h3 class="pull-right">Here are some ways you can improve on your algorithm:</h4><br><br><br>
      <ul>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Play with the input parameters</h4>
          <ul><li>By changing the various parameters for your algorithm, you can come up with a baseline error to begin working with.  In our case, we were able to change the max-depth of our trees, the number of trees we used, amount of features to use and the size of the subset of features each tree can choose from.</ul></li>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Error Driven Development</h4>
          <ul><li>Create or use a method to test where your algorithm is performing weakly.  By knowing where your error margins are greatest, you can develop new features to improve performance in these weak areas.  Improving in these weaker areas will give you a better overall result.</ul></li>
        <li><h4 class="text-info">Avoid overfitting or underfitting</h4>
          <ul><li>Overfitting will give you a low margin of error on your training set, but will not produce a great result when you introduce new data to predict on.  Underfitting will generally give you high margin of error across both training and new data.</ul></li>
